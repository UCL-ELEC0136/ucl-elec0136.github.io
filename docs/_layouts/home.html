            Welcome to the material of the Data Acquisition and Processing Systems (DAPS) course ELEC0136 at UCL. We are going to use GitHub Classroom to manage the programming exercises and final assignment. Since the final graded assignment will be managed through GitHub Classroom, it is strongly recommended to familiarise with the environment:
            <ul>
                <li>How to use GitHub and GitHub classroom</li>
                <li>How to accept your assignments</li>
                <li>How to commit code with your solutions</li>
                <li>How to ask for help and review</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="col col-12-of-12 right" id="trajectory">
            <h3>Using GitHub</h3>
            <div class="row right">
              If this is your first time using GitHub, it would be useful to complete the Git & GitHub Fundamentals assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/c5Me39XH.
              This assignment illustrates the basic functionalities of GitHub and how to work with them.
              Please make sure you work on the feedback branch!
