            Welcome to the material of the _Data Acquisition and Processing Systems_ (DaPS) course ELEC0136 at UCL.
            We are going to use GitHub Classroom to manage the programming exercises and final assignment.
            Since the final graded assignment will be managed through GitHub Classroom, it is strongly recommended to familiarise with the environment:
            <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                <li>How to use GitHub and GitHub classroom</li>
                <li>How to accept your assignments</li>
                <li>How to commit code with your solutions</li>
                <li>How to ask for help and review</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3> Using GitHub</h3>
            <div class="row">
                If this is your first time using GitHub, it would be useful to complete the _Git & GitHub Fundamentals_ assignment at https://classroom.github.com/a/c5Me39XH.
                This assignment illustrates the basic functionalities of GitHub and how to work with them. <b><u>Please make sure you work on the `feedback` branch!</u></b>

            <h3> Accepting an assignment</h3>
            <div class="row">
                Assignments will be distributed on the Moodle forum. You will find a link for each assignment. Once clicking on the link, you will have to accept the assignment. 
                When accepting an assignment, you will receive a repository to work on, one for each assignment.
                For example, if Katy accepted the assignment _2: Data Processing_, Katy will receive a personal repository to work on it named `daps-1-data-processing-katy`, where `katy` is your GitHub username.
